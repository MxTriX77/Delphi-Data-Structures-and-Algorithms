1. Binary Tree:  
   Binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the        right child.

2. CaesarEncryption:  
   Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely    known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some      fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so    on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

3. Euler's Function:  
   In number theory, Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n.

4. Huffman Code:  
   Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding      and/or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman.

5. Knuth–Morris–Pratt:  
   A simple Knuth–Morris–Pratt substring searching algorithm.

6. List:  
   List or sequence is an abstract data type that represents an ordered sequence of values, where the same value may occur more than        once.    An instance of a list is a computer representation of the mathematical concept of a finite sequence; the (potentially)          infinite analog    of a list is a stream.

7. PassBrute:  
   Simple bruteforce example.

8. Pyramid (binary heap):  
   A binary heap is defined as a binary tree with two additional constraints:
   -Shape property: a binary heap is a complete binary tree; that is, all levels of the tree, except possibly the last one (deepest) are     fully filled, and, if the last level of the tree is not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.
   -Heap property: the key stored in each node is either greater than or equal to or less than or equal to the keys in the node's           children, according to some total order.

9. Stack:  
   Stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to    the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

10. Trie (prefix tree, radix tree):  
    Trie is a kind of search tree—an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys     are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its             position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string       associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string.
